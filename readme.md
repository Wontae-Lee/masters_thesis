## 1. The SPH solver was referenced by the following website and thesis.

* coding style
Philip Mocz (2020) Princeton Univeristy, @PMocz
https://github.com/pmocz/sph-python

* kernel function
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
Techniques for the Physics Based Simulation of Fluids and Solids
Dan Koschier1, Jan Bender2, Barbara Solenthaler3, and Matthias Teschner4

## 2. My research was to find a relationship between SPH solver and machine learning models.

* simulation model: Reverse roll coating.
* machine learning algorithm: Multivariable Linear Regression.

## 3. This repository is not going to be updated except for fixing bugs.

## 4. You would find what you want on my other repositories.
